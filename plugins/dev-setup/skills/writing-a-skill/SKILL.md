# Writing Skills

## Process

1. **Gather requirements** — ask about:
   - What task/domain does the skill cover?
   - What specific use cases should it handle?
   - Does it need executable scripts or just instructions?

2. **Draft the skill** — create SKILL.md plus any reference files or scripts needed.

3. **Review with user** — confirm coverage, then iterate based on real usage.

## Skill Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required, keep under 500 lines)
├── references/        # Detailed docs (if needed)
│   └── topic.md
└── scripts/           # Utility scripts (if needed)
```

## SKILL.md Template

```md
---
name: skill-name # gerund form, lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars
description: One sentence what it does. Use when [specific triggers/keywords].
---

# Skill Name

[Minimal quick-start example inline]

## Workflows

[Step-by-step process. Add a checkbox checklist for complex multi-step tasks.]

## References

[Link out to separate files only if content would push SKILL.md past 500 lines. Example: **Form filling**: See [references/forms.md](references/forms.md)]

## Review Checklist

- [ ] [key step 1]
- [ ] [key step 2]
```

Omit any section that doesn't apply — don't leave empty placeholders.

## Naming

Prefer gerund form: `processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-spreadsheets`, `setting-up-npm-block`. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only, max 64 chars.

## Description

Third person. First sentence: what it does. Second sentence: `Use when [specific triggers/keywords]`. Max 1024 chars.

```
# Good
Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.

# Bad
Helps with documents.
```

## Progressive Disclosure

SKILL.md is a table of contents — load detail only when needed.

**Add scripts** when the operation is deterministic (validation, formatting) or the same code would be generated repeatedly. Scripts save tokens and improve reliability vs generated code.

**Split into reference files** when:

- SKILL.md body exceeds 500 lines
- Content has distinct domains (finance vs sales schemas)
- Some references are rarely needed

SKILL.md should link directly to reference files — those files must not link onward to further files.

**Three patterns for linking references:**

High-level guide — put the quick start inline, link detailed content under `## References`:

```md
## References

**Form filling**: See [references/forms.md](references/forms.md) **API reference**: See [references/api.md](references/api.md)
```

Domain-specific files — one file per domain so unrelated context is never loaded:

```
references/
├── finance.md   # revenue, billing
├── sales.md     # pipeline, accounts
└── product.md   # API usage, features
```

Conditional details — show the basic path inline, link the edge case:

```md
For simple edits, modify the XML directly. **For tracked changes**: See [references/redlining.md](references/redlining.md)
```

For reference files longer than 100 lines, add a table of contents at the top so Claude can navigate without reading the whole file.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Name uses gerund form
- [ ] Description includes "Use when..." with specific triggers
- [ ] SKILL.md body under 500 lines
- [ ] No time-sensitive information
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Concrete examples included
- [ ] References one level deep only
